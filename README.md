# Travieso Christmas Tree

This project is a fun and festive web application featuring an interactive Christmas tree. The tree "dodges" when you try to hover over it by moving to a random position on the screen. After the user attempts to interact with the tree 10 times, a click event is enabled that plays a surprise video on YouTube.

## Features

- **Mouse Dodge**: The Christmas tree randomly changes position on the screen when the mouse hovers over it.
- **Interaction Counter**: A counter tracks the number of times the user has attempted to interact with the tree.
- **Christmas Surprise**: On the tenth attempt, if the user clicks the tree, they are redirected to a surprise video on YouTube.
